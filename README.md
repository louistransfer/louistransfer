### Who I am

- My name is Louis, I have recently graduated from the X-HEC [MSc Data Science for Business](https://www.hec.edu/en/master-s-programs/x-hec-programs/master-science-data-science-business-x-hec) curriculum. I studied Machine Learning algorithms and Deep Learning networks (CNNs, KNNs, optimization techniques) as well as Data Engineering (Hadoop, Spark, SQL) techniques, applied to multiple business projects with companies such as BCG Gamma or Capgemini.
 
### Academia Projects

- I have worked on a prediction project which involved the search for additional datasets in order to predict a number of passengers on airlines. 
- I also worked on a CNN Lab which involved the training of a CNN on the CIFAR-10 dataset.
- I built a Reinforcment Learning project with Capgemini in order to train a rocket to land safely.

### Personal projects  

- I am expanding and maintaining a Python wrapper for the Jinka API (a website to look for appartment rentals): the project goal is to get a dataset of appartments available on the app as a CSV and Excel file containing various pieces of data about them, and to clean expired flat offers.

- I built an interactive webapp in order to present the results of my end of studies research paper on the use of data science techniques in the Venture Capital world.
